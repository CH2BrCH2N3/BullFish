Welcome to BullFish. After recording your zebrafish videos, this program will analyze their locomotion.
BullFish consists of 3 programs:
- [v]ideosetup: The user will select the video segment and swimming area for tracking and analysis.
                The selections will be saved as a csv file.
                This program will run through each video in the folder and repeat the selection process.
                For each video, the user can also state the angle for video rotation and area for
                cropping to facilitate the tracking.
- [t]racker: After videosetup, this program will automatically track the zebrafish and generate the
             representative coordinates of the zebrafish in each frame for each video.
             This can only be performed after the selections in videosetup have been saved.
- [a]nalysis: After the representative coordinates have been generated by [t]racker, this program will
              characterize individual episodes of movement and obtain the macro- and micro-parameters.
